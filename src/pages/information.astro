      Timelines are accelerating, old systems and institutions are in decline.
      The world's complexity is exploding beyond what our legacy collective
      mechanisms are capable of navigating. We are entering an age of great
      instability and uncertainty, while the enemies of civilization have never
      been more powerful. Yet, the promises of technological advancement have
      become all-encompassing. We find ourselves both on the cusp of a golden
      age of human flourishing and the violent decay of civilization.

      The emergence of Bitcoin and other Cryptoeconomic technologies has

      world's complex, adversarial and uncertain landscape. It appears as
      integral to whether the storms of the 21st century. Digital Currency can
      bridge the legacy monetary economy into a computable environment, opening
      a design space filled with astounding potential. The tech for webscale

      Most of the internet's potential has not yet been realized. The web yearns
      for better collective agency mechanisms, sense-making frameworks, memory
      models and forms to self-organize. Amongst all of us, a potent collective
      intelligence is latent, lacking the mechanisms to express itself
      effectively onto the world. This era demands for a new age of
      web-dynamism, enabled by novel economic tools on unstoppable uncensorable
      peer to peer substrates.
